### Video Script: "ROI Reporting Best Practices"

**[INTRO - 0:00-2:00]**

*[Screen: Executive boardroom with presentation]*

**Presenter:** "Marketing ROI reporting can make or break your budget discussions. This session shows you how to create compelling, defensible ROI reports that get C-suite buy-in and board approval."

**What We'll Cover:**
- Executive-level metrics and KPIs
- Attribution-based ROI calculation
- Board presentation best practices
- Handling challenging questions
- Automation and scalability

**[EXECUTIVE METRICS FRAMEWORK - 2:00-7:00]**

*[Screen: Metrics hierarchy diagram]*

**Presenter:** "Start with the metrics that matter to executives."

**Tier 1: Board-Level KPIs**
```python
board_metrics = {
    'marketing_roi': 5.2,  # Revenue / Investment
    'portfolio_roas': 5.2,  # Return on Ad Spend
    'revenue_attribution': 12500000,  # Total attributed revenue
    'market_share_impact': 0.28  # Current market share
}
```

**Tier 2: Strategic KPIs**
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Marketing Contribution to Pipeline
- Brand Awareness and Consideration

**Tier 3: Operational KPIs**
- Campaign-level ROAS
- Channel attribution percentages
- Cost per lead/acquisition
- Conversion rates by funnel stage

*[Screen: Dashboard showing all three tiers]*

**Presenter:** "Notice how we start strategic and get tactical. Never lead with tactical metrics in an executive presentation."

**[ATTRIBUTION-BASED ROI - 7:00-12:00]**

*[Screen: Attribution model comparison]*

**Presenter:** "Traditional ROI calculation is dangerously inaccurate. Here's how to calculate true, attribution-based ROI."

**Old Way (Last-Click):**
```python
# Misleading calculation
last_click_roi = direct_revenue / total_marketing_spend
# Result: 3.2x (undervalued)
```

**New Way (Multi-Touch Attribution):**
```python
from attribution_models import AttributionModelBuilder

builder = AttributionModelBuilder()
attribution_result = builder.build_attribution_model(
    customer_journeys, 
    AttributionModel.DATA_DRIVEN
)

true_roi = attribution_result.total_attributed_revenue / total_marketing_spend
# Result: 5.2x (accurate)
```

**Impact Visualization:**
*[Screen: Side-by-side comparison showing revenue attribution]*

- **Last-Click Model**: $8.2M attributed revenue
- **Multi-Touch Model**: $12.5M attributed revenue
- **Hidden Value**: $4.3M previously unattributed

**Statistical Confidence:**
```python
confidence_intervals = attribution_result.confidence_intervals
statistical_significance = attribution_result.statistical_significance

# 94% statistical significance
# 95% confidence interval: [4.8x, 5.6x] ROAS
```
