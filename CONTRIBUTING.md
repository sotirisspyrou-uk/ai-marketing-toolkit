#### 3. Code Standards

**Python Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting
- Use type hints for all public functions
- Write docstrings for classes and methods
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

**Documentation Style:**
```python
def optimize_campaign_bids(
    campaign_metrics: List[CampaignMetrics],
    target_roas: float = 4.0,
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.85
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Optimize campaign bid adjustments for maximum ROI.
    
    Args:
        campaign_metrics: Historical campaign performance data
        target_roas: Target return on ad spend (default: 4.0x)
        confidence_threshold: Statistical confidence required for recommendations
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping campaign IDs to recommended bid adjustments
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If insufficient historical data provided
        
    Example:
        >>> metrics = [CampaignMetrics(...)]
        >>> adjustments = optimize_campaign_bids(metrics, target_roas=5.0)
        >>> print(adjustments)
        {'campaign_1': 0.15, 'campaign_2': -0.10}
    """
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Performance tests for optimization algorithms
- Minimum 80% code coverage

```python
def test_campaign_optimization():
    """Test bid optimization with realistic campaign data."""
    # Arrange
    sample_campaigns = create_sample_campaigns()
    optimizer = CampaignOptimizer(test_credentials)
    
    # Act
    results = optimizer.optimize_bid_adjustments(sample_campaigns, target_roas=4.0)
    
    # Assert
    assert len(results) == len(sample_campaigns)
    assert all(-0.5 <= adj <= 0.5 for adj in results.values())  # Reasonable bounds
    assert results['high_performing_campaign'] > 0  # Should increase good campaigns
```

## üìä Performance Standards

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Accuracy**: Models must achieve >85% prediction accuracy on test data
- **Performance**: Optimization algorithms must complete within 30 seconds for 1000 campaigns
- **Scalability**: Code must handle enterprise-scale data (10M+ touchpoints)
